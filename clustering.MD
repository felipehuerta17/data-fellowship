# Clustering

## Brief:
Identify and clasify by ethnicity and house income the inhabitants in South Ealing,
expecting to find wealthy Indians

The region is E00006730, South Acton

Ethnic groups is a categorical variable
NS-SEC (National statistics, socioeconomical classifications) is also a categorical variable

But I found that k-means is not applicable to categorical data

Then we will use numerical data

1. Household size
2. Number of bedrooms

*Part 5: The type of data was fixed*
